#Initial Questions

These are questions we would like to ask our Technical Director, Joshua Lyle, as we assemble our formal project proposal.

- What type of data is meant to be sent?
- Would a proof of concept with a known, controlled client and known, controlled server be an appropriate final product?
- Are there particular communication channels of interest?
- Any opinion on splitting data streams between ISPs as an obfuscation measure?
