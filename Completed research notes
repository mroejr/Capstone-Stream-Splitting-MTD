This site will discuss what could be a good way to handle network interface to connect to the internet. It goes on the say that the use of a socket model would be a good path to take. This will help with handling the Network layer. It gives some sample code to help in the production of interface.

IETF:
IPv6 Specification;
This site covers all standers of the IPv6. This site was found when looking for the Extension Header standers. It was found that you can exclude a node, but you can not prevent that node from getting the packet. The node will receive the packet and then drop that packet because in the Extension Header you can set it to be dropped by that IP address. This is not what we were looking for, the node needed to be completely avoided.
