# Literature Review

The following is a collection of past research project that were conducted on stream splitting moving target defense. There are a number of different
sources from unique authors that offer a lot of background knowledge in the area of stream splitting. The applications of stream splitting
specifically for moving target defense are not quite as thouroughly researched which provides an interesting opportunity.

1. "***A Measurement-based Study of MultiPath TCP
Performance over Wireless Networks***"

I will put my summary of this paper here.
